# Veterinary-Clinic
This is a personal project to show my OOP skills in an easy and interesting way!

The idea here is to run a veterinary clinic with different pets as patients that can be added or removed and sign up for appointment times with different doctors.

Doctors--
Will be specialized with certain animals. When signing a pet up for an apt, a doctor with that a specialty in that animal type will be assigned as that pet's vet. Each doctor will get a schedule, and apointments and issues will be tracked. Overlapping apointments will not be allowed for a sigle doctor or pet. Pets must have a doctor with their animal category as a specialty. Appointment costs will also be tracked as an attribute of the pet along with other information such as Breed, Name, weight, birthday, last and next apt datetimes, and each visits' reason/issue.

{Different Pet Classes for each Pet Type the Clinic Accepts}
Dogs--
Breed/Type: German Shepherd, Lab, etc

Cats--
Breed/Type: Domestic, Main-coon, etc

Reptiles--
Breed/Type: Bearded Dragon, Lepard Gecco, etc

Rodents--
Breed/Type: Rat, Hamster, Rabbit, etc
